# Governance

## Core Principles

- Members are chosen and promoted to various committees based on their actual
  contributions.
- Members work towards the overall health and adoption of a more open
  ecosystem and agnostic to interests of the companies they represent.

## Contributors

- Open - Anyone can contribute but needs to sign a contributor license.
  See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
- All code changes need to be approved by at least 1 maintainer elected by
  Tech Council (TC) and all TC members are cc’ed.

## Maintainers

- Responsible for reviewing and approving code changes to ensure they align
  with the project's technical standards and governance principles.
- Build tools and documentation to facilitate adoption of the protocol.
- Tech Council (TC) can add, remove & nominate maintainers as needed.
- All code changes require approval from at least one Maintainer.

### Domain Working Groups (DWG)

- Because the TC cannot be experts in every field, Domain Working Groups
  (DWG) may be formed as a natural part of expanding the protocol.
- DWG are subject to TC oversight - all DWG artifacts must be reviewed and
  approved by the TC.
- Acts as the consensus venue for industry participants (e.g., multiple
  airlines) to agree on shared interoperability standards within the
  protocol, maintain the specific documentation and implementation guides for
  their domain's capabilities.
- A group of 3+ organizations can submit a charter to the Governing Council
  to form a DWG (e.g., "Travel WG"). Once chartered, the DWG has autonomy to
  define capabilities for their domain and submit for TC approvals.

## Tech Council (TC)

- Responsible for maintaining core technical changes to the spec, e.g., adding
  new features, reviewing enhancement proposals etc.
- Elected by the Governing Council (GC).
- Includes 8 core members, 4 from each founding organization (Google &
  Shopify), each with 1 vote (total 8 votes).
- Includes 4 members from any org, each with 1 vote (total 4 votes), elected
  by the TC every 6 months, based on their technical contributions towards the
  protocol. Members can be re-elected any number of times.
- Decisions are made with a majority vote.
- Any TC member may request a review from the Governing Council at any time
  for any additional inputs.

## Governing Council (GC)

- Responsible for governance, overall health and adoption of the protocol.
- GC serves as the ultimate owner of all UCP assets. Google
  acts as the custodian of the UCP.dev domain, holding and managing it solely
  for the benefit of the Council and the partnership’s collective interests.
- Includes a total of 2 core members, with each founding organization
  (Google & Shopify) having 1 core member, each with 1 vote (total 2 votes).
- Includes 1 member elected annually by the GC for contributions to the
  protocol's health and adoption from any organization. For the first year,
  this seat is open, and Google holds the proxy vote for this seat, to
  facilitate rapid early stage growth & adoption of the protocol.
- Can add/remove TC members via simple majority vote.
- May choose to review and veto TC decision or recommendation.
- Decisions are made with a majority vote.

## Communication

To ensure the protocol remains open and agnostic, all governance activities must
be visible, accessible, and searchable. All communication that is intended to be
public (concerning, e.g., adding a capability before creating an extension,
debating one approach versus another, or announcements relating to upcoming
launches, etc.) shall take place on a shared Google group with a mailing list.
This includes discussion on enhancement proposals, announcements about official
specification changes and final governance votes.

- **TC & DWG Meetings:** Agendas should be posted 24 hours in advance. Minutes
  and meeting notes should be published to the repository within 1 week of the
  meeting conclusion. TC reserves the right to redact or edit meeting notes as
  needed.
- **Governing Council Meetings:** Summaries of strategic decisions and budget
  allocations will be published quarterly (specific sensitive partnership
  discussions may remain private).
